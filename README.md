        The reason why I'm here is probably the irrational hate for trees and love for potatoes and gingers!

    <p>Hello, how's it going? I like to like stuff and dislike said stuff after some time. I also like to dislike people who dislike those who dislike, and also those who like those who dislike. So, I dislike almost everyone, since basically everyone dislikes someone who, in revenge, dislikes them. But they like themselves, so they like someone who dislikes someone. Hence, I do not like even myself, since I also dislike someone. And since I do not like someone, but I love myselfâ€”that is, I like someone who dislikes what I dislikeâ€”then I also dislike myself in that way too, since I can't seem to dislike what I like. I do not like nor dislike my likes and dislikes, yet I do like and I do dislike something or someone.</p>
